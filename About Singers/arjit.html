  <p>
    Arijit Singh (born April 25, 1987) is one of the most successful singers and composers of India. Singh has set a record of six “Best Male Playback Singer Filmfare awards.” As of 2020, Arijit is the most streamed artist for Spotify India.

Arijit started his career on a reality show named “Fame Gurukul.” In spite of not winning nor getting proper exposure, he got acknowledged by Mithoon. With Mithoon’s help, he would get into the mainstream through his first single, “Phir Mohabbat.”

As he was finding his footing in the mainstream as a playback singer, he was offered the soundtrack on the movie Aashiqui 2. Singles from the movie which includes “Tum Hi Ho” and “Chahun Main Ya Naa” helped him gain the exposure and recognization that he always deserved.
